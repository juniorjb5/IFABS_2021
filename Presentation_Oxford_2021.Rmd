•	Diapositiva 4 - 5 – Introducción

Understanding the sources of profitability in the banking sector is of utmost importance to both policy makers and professionals in the banking sector.

On the one hand, the profitability of banks, as it is directly related to the soundness of financial institutions, implies a relationship with financial stability and the probability of systemic risk, the profitability is then under intense surveillance (surveilens) by regulators and central banks.

On the other hand, profitability is also an objective indicator of managers and CEOs who determining optimal combinations of operating assets and sources of capital, hoping to increase the value of a bank and its return on investment.

## Idiosyncratic characteristics vs. Common market forces

.font120[
There is a lively debate in the literature about whether profitability in banks is mainly due to idiosyncratic characteristics of financial institutions, such as `size`, `scope`, `capitalization`, `asset quality`, `efficiency`, and the `business model`, or, in contrast, is more a reflection of underlying common market forces, over which bank managers lack any kind of influence, such as `short-term policy rates`, `long-term rates`, `general financial conditions`, or more broadly speaking, `cycles in economic activity`.]

•	Diapositiva 6 – Introducción

Now, this has opened up a lively debate in the literature about whether bank profitability is primarily due to idiosyncratic characteristics of financial institutions or common market forces.

Naturally, profitability responds to both sides of the narrative. Since it is inevitable that characteristics of the bank influence the levels of profitability of the bank.

On the other hand, it is also essential that bank profitability is affected by a reflection of the underlying common market forces, over which bank managers have no influence whatsoever, such as short-term policy rates, interest rates long-term, general financial conditions or, more generally, cycles of economic activity.

But ... in this case the key point we have wondered about is the degree to which one can trust each side to explain the performance of the banking system.

In our work, we answer to what extent the profitability of the largest banks in the US banking system can be explained by common underlying market forces, which are not related to idiosyncratic characteristics.

In other words, we have fo(ou)cused on the determinants of bank profitability in the US economy, focusing especially on macroeconomic determinants rather than individual characteristics of banks.

We take an eclectic perspective based on dynamic factor models, which are often used in machine learning asset pricing, but are novel in the context of our research question.

This group of factors includes fundamental macroeconomic determinants and market factors, such as competence and market share. The profitability of banks is affected by the economic cycle, short-term interest rates, inflation expectations, credit risk, and the effect of the structure of the loan portfolio on profits.

•	Diapositiva 8 - 9 – Literatura

It is possible to identify in the literature two lines of analysis related to the determinants of the performance of financial institutions: Internal determinants and external determinants.

Among the internal determinants, authors such as Le & Ngo, Kumar, Duan, Fernandes, Davydov, Evans, among others, highlight determinants of profitability such as the structure and size of the assets, as well as the financial and capital structure. Among operational aspects, for example, the number of ATMs and customer service offices are highlighted.

Authors such as Kanas, Martins, Alessandri, Molyneaux, Borio, among others, highlight external determinants of the bank's profitability in their research. The authors show external aspects such as the economic cycle, short-term interest rates, inflation expectations, among others.
Our goal will be to fill a significant gap in the literature by exploring potential sources of profitability from a big data perspective. Our approach builds-on and expands-on knowledge from the previous literature linking bank profitability with macroeconomics.

•	Diapositiva 10 - 11 – Metodología

While it is a fact already documented in the literature and well known to central banks and professionals that banking is a highly cyclical industry and therefore dominated by underlying macro market forces, which determine most of the dynamics of a bank's performance. We offer a way to quantify the extent to which this occurs.

Our approach allows us to directly quantify how much of the profitability of US banks can be explained by some common factors that all financial institutions are directly exposed to.

We structure four main stages. 
We estimate a model by dynamic factors, select the optimal number of factors, and estimate the factors based on the regularized principal components analysis. 
We then interpret our estimated factors and finally, 
We provide a ranking of banks regarding the sensitivity of our estimated factors.

<div class="my-logo-right"></div>



# Dynamic factor models


<br>

.font120[
We adapt our exposition form `Bai & Ng (2002)` and `Bai & Ng (2008)`. Let $y_{it}$ be the observed profitability data (either ROE, ROA, and EBITDA) for the i-th unit of the cross-section (i.e., bank) at time t, for $i=1,\ldots,N$ and $t=1,\ldots,T.$ Consider the following model:

<br>

$$y_{it}=\lambda_i^\prime\ F_t+e_{it}$$

$$y_{it}=C_{it}+e_{it},$$
<br>

where $F_t$ is a vector of common factors, $e_{it}$ is the idiosyncratic component of $y_{it}$ and $\lambda_i$ is a vector of factor loads associated with $F_t$. This is a vector of weights that unit $i$ places on the corresponding $r$ static common factors $F_t$. The term $C_{it}=\lambda_iF_t$ refers to the common component of the model.

]

???

•	Diapositiva 12 – Modelo Factores Dinamicos

We use a dynamic factor model to explain the unobservable market-wide forces that determine bank profitability.

Consider the following model, where the response variable is the profitability data, either ROE, ROA and EBITDA for each bank in the cross section at the moment T. 

F is the vector of common factors and e is the idiosyncratic component.

# Selecting the number of factors

<br>

.font120[
The number of optimal factors $\hat{k}$ is obtained from the estimation of the corresponding factor loadings that accompany the observed factors, which can be consistently estimated from $\hat{k}=\arg{{\min}_{0\le k\le kmax}PC(k)}$ with $r\le kmax$. Let:



$$PC\left(k\right)=V\left(k,{\hat{F}}^k\right)+kg\left(N,T\right),$$

where $PC\left(k\right)$ is the loss function. It is used to estimate $\hat{k}$, where $g\left(N,T\right)$ is an overfitting penalty, $\hat{F}^k$ is the matrix of $k$ estimated factors and $V\left(k,{\hat{F}}^k\right)$ denotes the sum of squared residuals





]


???

•	Diapositiva 13 – Selecting the number of factors

The number of optimal factors is obtained from the estimation of the corresponding factor loadings that accompany the observed factors.

A strategy frequently used to estimate the optimal number of factors (r) is the graphical representation of the system’s eigenvalues. 

In contrast, a more transparent and quantitative way to determine the number of factors in the system is to balance the cost of adding an additional factor with increasing model complexity, and it was proposed by Bai & Ng (2020) (twenty-twenty)

# The (regularized) iterative PCA algorithm

<br>

.font120[
In the estimation of the banking profitability factors $\hat{F}$, we use the method of regularized principal components, due to `Josse & Husson (2012)`. The objective is to determine a subspace that reduces the distances between individuals and their projections in this subspace. This is equivalent to finding two matrices $F_{T\times S}$ and $U_{N\times S}$ of rank $S$, with $S<T$, that provide the best approximation of the matrix of the original dataset $X_{T\times N}$, with *T: Time* and *N: Banks*, in the least-squares sense, that minimize the following criteria:



$$\vartheta = || Χ-M-FU'||^2 = \sum_{t=1}^{T}{\sum_{n=1}^{N}\left(X_{tn}-m_n-\sum_{s=1}^{S}{F_{ts}U_{ns}}\right)^2}$$


where $M$ is a matrix of size $T\times K$ with each row equal to $(m_1,\ \ldots,\ m_N)$, i.e., the vector with the mean of each variable.

# Interpreting the factors

<br>

.font120[
We used FRED-QD database comprising of 248 macroeconomic series, we denote each series by $MS_k,$ where $k\ =1,\ \ldots,\ 248$. The objective is to establish, based on the marginal determination coefficient of exahustive regressions, the top 5 macroeconomic variables that best explain each banking factor $i$. We then have 248 values of $R_{Adj}^2$ extracted from each $k$ model

<br>

$$ {\hat{F}}_{Bank_p}=\ \gamma_0+\ \gamma_1MS_k+u_k $$
]


???

•	Diapositiva 15 – interpreting Factors

We go a step further by considering the interpretation of our statistical factors, estimated by regularized principal components analysis (PCA). 

Our approach consists of the following two steps. 
First, we collect quarterly series of US economic activity recently assembled by McCracken & Ng (2021)(twenty-twenty one), which together constitute a complete picture of real markets, financial markets and prices in the US. 

Then, we relate each of our statistical factors to each series in the set of big data macro variables and select the heaviest loading series among them, using marginal R-squared statistics from exhaustive and separated regressions and thereby matching our statistical factors with well-known economic series that can be easily interpreted.

•	Diapositiva 16 – DATA

Our data for US banking profitability and the macroeconomic environment come from two different sources.

Banking information: We use three financial indicators to measure profitability ROE, ROA and EBITDA margin. Each indicator in an individual analysis to observe the consistency of the results.

In the case of return on equity, we use 118 (one hundred eighteen) banks with quarterly series from 2001(Two thousand one) to 2020(twenty-twenty). In the case of return on assets, there are 111(one hundred eleven) banks. For EBITDA margin we use 241(two hundred forty-one) banks with annual information. We mainly focus(FOUKOAS) on the return on equity results to do the general analysis. These indicators come from REFINITIV.

Regarding the macroeconomic information, we use the FRED-QD database consolidated by McCracken & Ng (2021)(twenty twenty-one), which contains 248(two hundred forty-eight) series.

•	Diapositiva 17 - 18 – Results Table

The table shows the percentage of the total variance in the panel for each of our three profitability indicators, ROE, ROA, EBITDA, explained by the three estimated bank profitability factors.

We observe a high percentage of the total variation of the system explained by the three factors selected in the first step, that is, between 63(Sixty-three)% and 68(Sixty-eight)% for the three profitability indicators.

This result is robust when using ROE, ROA, and even EBITDA margin, which is sampled at a different frequency.. and... consists of a cross-sectional sample size.. more than twice, that of ROE and ROA. 

However, the percentage of explained variance increases for large banks compared to small ones.

(Cambiar pestañas)

- In the case of small banks, we have a percentage of explained variance between 57(fifty-seven)% and 65(Sixty-five)%.,,, 

- For medium banks we have between 68(sixty-eigth)% and 71(seventy-one)%,,, 

- and finally, for large banks we have of explained variance between 69(sixty-nine)% and 75(seventy-five)%.

The fact, that all three factors explain similar percentages of the total variance for ROE and ROA, rather than EBIDTA, confirms our number of selected factors.

(señalar las lineas.. hacer click)

This figure shows the behavior of the estimated factors including all banks, this is the solid line. The behavior of the factors estimated by bank size is also shown, these are the dashed lines.

We can see for each financial indicator how our factors manage to capture the subprime and covid-19 (nineteen) crises.

This behavior can be captured both in the factors from the ROE.
(Cambiar) In the same way in the ROA, (señalar crisis)
(Cambiar) and.. of course the EBITDA also captures the crises.


(Cambiar) We also estimate macroeconomic factors from the set of FRED-QD series. Although these estimated factors capture crises, the trend does not resemble banking factors.

Interestingly, our banking factors do not perfectly (or even closely) match three additional factors estimated using the macroeconomic series related to economic activity, prices and financial conditions. 

The largest correlation (in magnitude) among the banking and macroeconomic factors is -0.44 (mi(ai)nus zero point forty-four), appearing between the second banking factor and the third macroeconomic factor. 

Otherwise, the two sets of factors depict largely independent trajectories, which highlights the advantages of our approach against the alternative path of identifying the market factors directly from the set of macroeconomic series.

Now, the interpretability..

Our statistical factors are estimated outside the macro system, that is, from our banking profitability data. 

Therefore, there is no a prior reason to expect a high correlation between the factors and the individual series. 
Bearing this in mind, we are still able to identify what series drive the dynamics of each banking profitability factor, which makes our results solid and insightful. 


- The first factor is related to the financial burden of households and economic activity: We have variables such as: Real total Liabilities of households, Industrial production such as: Manufacturing and Total industry, and Money and Credit variables.

(Cambiar)
- the second factor is associated with household income and, hence, employment, With variables like: Average weekly hours of production and nonsupervisory employees and Help-Wanted Index.

(Cambiar)
- and the third factor is related to commercial loans, that is, Companies’ indebtedness and government debt.

We show the kernel of the probability distribution of the adjusted R-squared. In this way, we can evaluate the individual adjustment of the banking profitability dynamic factor model in the cross-section of banks. 

According to Figure is greater than 64(sixty-four)% for more than half of the banks... and above 77(seventy-seven)% for more than a quarter of the banks. This shows a high adjustment of the dynamic factor model for the panel of financial institutions.

•	Diapositiva 23 – Results Ranking

We can provide a ranking of banks according to their sensitivity to the three underlying market forces.

Remember, Factor 1 is associated with Level of household indebtedness and economic activity.
That is, our first component already has an intuitive dynamic (for example, it falls during crises), we already know that the most vulnerable institutions are those with positive coefficients, that is, (upper ranking).

Here, the most sensitive banks are: Central Pacific Financial Corp, Synovus Financial Corp, United Community Banks Inc (Incorporated) and these banks follow.(señalar otros bancos)
In contrast, the least sensitive banks to the first factor are German American Bancorp Inc, UMB Financial Corp, among others.

Factor 2 is associated with Household income and employment, Here the most sensitive banks are: Central Pacific Financial Corp, Synovus Financial Corp, Huntington Bancshares Inc, among others. The least sensitive banks are: Westamerica Bancorp and Valley National Bancorp.

And factor 3 is associated with Companies' indebtedness and government debt. Here, the most sensitive banks are: Popular Inc, Huntington Bancshares Inc and Republic Bancorp Inc. The least sensitive banks are: Central Pacific Financial Corp and Old Second Bancorp Inc.

1)
We estimate the number of statistical factors that underlie profitability dynamics over time for the banking industry. Three factors are enough to describe 63.40%, 68% and 67.50% of ROE, ROA and EBITDA, respectively.


2)
The numbers increase according to bank size, which indicates that, as expected, the larger the bank is, the more cyclically it behaves.

3)

Our results indicate that these three statistical factors are mainly related to:

- households’ financial burden and economic activity
- households’ income and employment
- commercial loans


4)
We provide a means to monitor profitability in the banking industry from an integrative perspective by establishing rankings of the financial institutions according to their exposure (either positive or negative) to the three market forces that we identify.

and.. finally...

Given that our results seem more relevant for large banks than for small banks, it could be that for banks outside of our sample, which are even smaller, the results lack the same validity.
